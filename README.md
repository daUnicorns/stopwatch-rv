# Create a stopwatch with TDD

## The Task

Our task is to create a stopwatch using test driven development (TDD). We will be using QUnit to run the tests.

We will be writing tests, watching them tests fail and then trying the write code to pass said tests.

#### Quick side note

(We might end up veering of course and end up writing some code that does not have tests 😁 so we sincerely apologize for when and if that happens (it does happen 😢. Sorry)).
